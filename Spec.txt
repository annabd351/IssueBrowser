Create a simple iOS client app for the github issues API:
https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/

Using this github project:
https://github.com/grpc/grpc-swift

- The user should see a list of issues of the repo, ordered by number of unique commenters, from most to least.
- Each item in the list should show the title of the issue, the creation date of the issue, and the creator's username
- The user should be able to tap an issue to see a detail view of the issue. The detail view should contain:
- The Title of the issue
- the full text of the issue
- the author of the issue
- The names of all the commenters, ordered by number of comments, most to least. If some commenters have the same number of comments, they should be ordered alphabetically.
- Design and UX is up to you as long as the information is displayed clearly. Prefer standard iOS patterns when possible.

Optional additions if you have time or interest:
- Add some form of caching to improve user experience. Implementation is up to you.
- Make the issue list paged or infinite scrolling
- Write some unit tests for any parts of your app that could benefit from them
- Add a text field to display issues from an arbitrary github project via the project's url rather than a hardcoded project

Design Considerations:
- The app can be written in Swift or Objective-c.
- Focus on the functionality and clean architecture rather than the UI design. It should work correctly,  be robust, and not crash.
- Use your judgement regarding the use of third-party frameworks. If you choose to use one, please provide your rationale for choosing this framework vs alternatives or native options.
